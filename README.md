parley
======

A small group tutorial, argumentative dialogue tool.

Parley is designed to support small tutorial groups whose members are working remotely from each other, for example distance learners, and who are learning about difficult domainans and hard real-world problems where there are not necessarily any right or wrong answers, but various degrees of more or less informed, and more of less justified positions.

An additional benefit of Parley is that it is designed to support the use of intelligent software tutors, which we will call agents, that aim to help the learner to explore difficult areas of the domain, for example, leading them through more complex data, or asking 'devils advocate' style questions in order to discover the extents of the learner's knowledge.
